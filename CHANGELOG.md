## [2.0.3] - Renamed "limit" to "max"

Current value and maximum now can be changed. Increment is now mutable.

There is no "limit" now, there is a "max" representing maximum value increment's value can take. This should improve readability.

Changes required if "limit" was utilized.

## [1.0.1] - Now supporting custom limit number

## [1.0.0] - Initial release
